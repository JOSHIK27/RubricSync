        Evaluate the content of each section against the rubric's expectations.

    Provide Detailed Feedback:
        Highlight strengths: Identify and explain the aspects of the report that meet or exceed the rubric criteria.
        Identify areas for improvement: Point out where the report falls short of the rubric's expectations and provide specific suggestions for improvement.

    Assign Scores:
        For each criterion in the rubric, assign a score based on the report's performance.
        Justify each score with a brief explanation.

    Overall Evaluation:

        Offer final comments and general advice for future assignments.

Example Format for Feedback:

Criterion 1: Clarity of Argument

    Score: 8/10
    Feedback: The argument is generally clear and well-articulated. However, the introduction could provide more background information to set the context.

Criterion 2: Use of Evidence

    Score: 6/10
    Feedback: The report uses several good sources, but some claims are not well-supported by evidence. Consider integrating more peer-reviewed articles to strengthen your arguments.

Overall Evaluation:
The report demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and meets most of the rubric's criteria. To improve, focus on providing more background information and stronger evidence for your claims.
